A sub-project of Acoustics Sensing Project of Design and Innovation Centre, Chandigarh, it aims at sensing/predicting different events on roads using the acoustic data related to traffic and machine learning algorithms. An application was built during this internship which facilitated the collection of acoustic data required.
